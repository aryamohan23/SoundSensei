you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined You mustve had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign Kept on drivin straight and left our future to the right Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I cant face And memories are somethin even smoking weed does not replace And I am terrified of weather cause I see you when it rains Doc told me to travel but theres COVID on the planes And I love Vermont but its the season of the sticks And I saw your mom she forgot that I existed And its half my fault but I just like to play the victim Ill drink alcohol til my friends come home for Christmas And Ill dream each night of some version of you That I might not have but I did not lose Now youre tire tracks and one pair of shoes And Im split in half but thatll have to do So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad

season of the sticks And I saw your mom she forgot that I existed And its half my fault but I just like to play the victim Ill drink alcohol til my friends come home for Christmas And Ill dream each night of some version of you That I might not have but I did not lose Now youre tire tracks and one pair of shoes And Im split in half but thatll have to do Oh thatll have to do My other half was you I hope this pains just passin through But I doubt it And I love Vermont but its the season of the sticks And I saw your mom she forgot that I existed And its half my fault but I just like to play the victim Ill drink alcohol til my friends come home for Christmas And Ill dream each night of some version of you That I might not have but I did not lose Now youre tire tracks and one pair of shoes And
