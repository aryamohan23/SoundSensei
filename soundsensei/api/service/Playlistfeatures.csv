Outside the light departed
Now were back back to where we started
We were found on the ground isolated and
Suffocated and beaten down again
Pick up the fragments of my broken bones
Stitch them together to make myself whole
Under the surface my skin starts to crawl
Take me back to where we started
 revеlation


I dont even want a sanctuary
Just a little bit of convеrsation
Like a vision only I can see
This could be another 
 

 
Outside a world divided
Find a wall crawl and hide behind it
We were bound on the ground separated and
Suffocated and beaten down again
Made up the answers and bury the truth
All of the secrets are following you
Under the surface Ive hidden it all
Take me back to where we started

I dont even want a sanctuary

Ive been living in a reverie
But Im waking up for my salvation
I dont even need a remedy
This could be another 








I dont even want a sanctuary
Just a little bit of conversation
Like a vision only I can see
This could be another 
I dont even want a sanctuary Woah
This could be another 
Like a vision only I can see Woah
This could be another

Youre wretched spewing venom
In every single lie that you tell
Feigning all emotion when facing the consequence of your own personal hell
And theres no angel left to blame
When the devil on your shoulder who made you bolder
Is the one laughing in your face
What goes around comes around someday


And every time I think about the words youve said
Im reminded just to bite my tongue instead
Until every last lyrics left covered in red
Because the taste of blood is
Better than the taste better than the 

 
So while youre spitting into the hurricane
Trying to get rid of the bitterness
The acid from your tongue begins to erode again
While you sit and reminisce
So deep inside your own abyss
There is no feeling of misery like living in history
When youve been so poisonous
Karma comes back to sink its fangs right in your neck

Say we waited it out
Lost ourselves in temptation
From nothing at all


When the Sunday morning comes when the Sunday morning comes
Youll be smoking like a gun and Im

Ooh no its never enough its never enough

Ooh no its never enough its never enough

 
Say we needed salvation
Say we gave up the fight
Found our reincarnation
In nothing at all in nothing at all
